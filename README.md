# PreparingTheKanji

PreparingTheKanji is an app that makes adding custom stories to [this RTK 6th Edition deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1654787298) easier.

## Usage

1. Make sure you installed the AnkiConnect plugin in Anki.
2. Install the dependencies with the command `npm i`.
3. Start PreparingTheKanji with the command `npm start FullDeckName`.  
**Example:** `npm start "Japanese::Kanji::RTK"`
4. You can now start adding stories at http://localhost:3000.

## Note

This is a small app I put together in a few hours. I made it because copying and pasting stories from Koohii was annoying and slow and I wanted to automate it. The app is functional but code quality wasn't a priority.
